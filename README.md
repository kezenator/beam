Physical Ray-tracing experiment

I've always had an interest in ray tracing, from back in the early 90s
when I first learned about PovRay. I've written quite a few different
raytracers over the years.

Recently (March 2021) I came across
[_Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series_](https://raytracing.github.io/)
and I'm afraid to say I was stunned by how simple the
Monte Carlo method of diffuse lighting and caustics was.
I'm afraid to say this was kind of news to me (or perhaps forgotten)
and I was really taken by it. Especially the one line throwaway at
the end about chaging from the RGB colourspace to wavelength.

I thought - oh wow I could get some rainbows coming out of
prisims.

This is my little attempt at trying this out.
